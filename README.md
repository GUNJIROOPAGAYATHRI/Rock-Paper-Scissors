# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where the user plays against the computer. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to handle the user interface and game logic. The goal is to create an interactive and engaging game that allows users to compete with a computer opponent.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The game is a classic hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:  
- **Rock** (crushes Scissors)  
- **Paper** (covers Rock)  
- **Scissors** (cuts Paper)  

In this version, the user competes against the computer. The game is designed to handle multiple rounds, updating the score after each game. The interface includes images for each choice (rock, paper, scissors), and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game.
